## What does it do?
This is the first of two project assignments in our course. Note that the assignments are not ‘stand-alone’,
but rather build on top of each other to form a bigger project.
The overall goal of this project is to build Studybot, an intelligent agent that can
answer university course-related questions using a knowledge graph and natural language
processing.
For example, Studybot will be able to answer questions such as, “What is course COMP
474 about?”, “Which topics were covered in the second lecture in COMP474?” and
“Which courses at Concordia teach deep learning?”

## Studybot’s Knowledge Graph Vocabulary.
To be able to answer questions, Studybot needs knowledge
about courses, lectures, and their content. Thus, the first step in this part of the project is the construction
of a knowledge graph, built using standard W3C technologies, in particular RDF and RDFS. 

## Automated Knowledge Base Construction.
In this first part, collect and organize the material for the two courses into suitable datasets (e.g., folders
with lectures, slides, etc.). Give each item an automatically generated URI that you can use to identify the
item. 

In the second part of the project, we will automatically extract information about topics using NLP
techniques from these datasets. For this first part of the project, simply create a few triples manually
that demonstrate how the knowledge base will look like (e.g., modeling a few topics for our course).

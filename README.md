# COMP 474 Project

## What does it do?
This is the first of two project assignments in our course. Note that the assignments are not ‘stand-alone’,
but rather build on top of each other to form a bigger project.
The overall goal of this project is to build Studybot, an intelligent agent that can
answer university course-related questions using a knowledge graph and natural language
processing.
For example, Studybot will be able to answer questions such as, “What is course COMP
474 about?”, “Which topics were covered in the second lecture in COMP474?” and
“Which courses at Concordia teach deep learning?”
